"""Audit the brand theme tokens: WCAG contrast + colorblind confusability.

Parses the live theme (:root + .dark in src/app.css) and, if present, any
[data-brand=...] evaluation blocks. Checks the standard shadcn token pairs
against WCAG AA and simulates protanopia/deuteranopia/tritanopia to flag
hue-only distinctions between semantic colors (primary / accent /
destructive / highlight). Keep this at 0 failures after ANY token edit —
this is the accessibility contract documented in app.css and CLAUDE.md.

Three families of check, each of which can fail the exit code:

1. TEXT_PAIRS — opaque token-on-token pairs (`text-foreground` on `bg-card`).
2. COMPOSITED_PAIRS — translucent recipes (`text-primary` on `bg-primary/10`
   over `bg-card`). See that list's own comment. This family exists because
   alpha over a surface is exactly where AA fails silently: hand-computed
   ratios written into code comments were wrong repeatedly during the 2026-08
   rebrand (a claimed "3.1" that measured 2.95; a ToneTile table that did not
   reproduce; an 18.46 that was really 17.46) because nothing executed them.
   These entries execute them. Issue #783.
3. Color-blind separation between the semantic colors.

When you add a translucent recipe to a component, add it here too and let the
script produce the number for the comment, rather than the other way round.
